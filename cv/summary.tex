\begin{cvparagraph}
	I'm a developer currently living in \textbf{Kuala Lumpur}. I'm planning to move back to \textbf{Amsterdam} at the end of this year. Before that I can be available remotely and I'll be in Amsterdam from the 1st of July till the 15th of August.

	The most important thing I'm looking for is something that is fun. I would like to work in a \textbf{small team} where I can influence things and have some freedom. I have experience leading teams but I prefer to write code over managing other people.

	I prefer to work with \textbf{Golang, C or C++}. I prefer to do backend code and devops but I also have experience doing frontend code (just not design!).

	In my spare time I got some minor experience with \textbf{OpenGL} trying to build my own game, low level things such as \textbf{assembly}, \textbf{BIOS}, \textbf{virtual memory}, \textbf{interrupts} writing my own \textbf{OS} and \textbf{VHDL} (hardware design) building my own \textbf{CPU}.
