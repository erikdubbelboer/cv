\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Erik Dubbelboer. I was born in Utrecht in the Netherlands. When I was 16 I started programming computers, building an AI for Half-Life in C++, a year later I created my own simple multi-tasking operating system. Before I was done with my studies I had already founded multiple companies with friends. One of these companies led me to live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where I met my wife. My current company Atomx.com is coming to an end and I'm ready for a new challenge.

\lettersection{Why DigitalOcean?}
In the topic on \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/8wdfk6/digitalocean\_is\_looking\_for\_a\_sr\_backend\_go/}{\textcolor{link}{Reddit}} I read `\textit{Ideally at least 3 years of experience with low latency, high throughput, data processing at scale using Go.}` which fits me perfectly. I have 4 years experience with Go building an advertising exchange which required latencies less than 100ms for thousands of requests per second. The exchange also featured a fast realtime reporting pipeline allowing users to run reports on many metrics and dimensions. I like working with big amounts of data. The other part that a liked about the job is that it can be done remotely but has the option to go to an office as well.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I already have a lot of experience with the technologies and concepts the job requires. I like analyzing large amounts of data to find interesting patterns, something I did a lot at atomx.com as well. I'm not really tied down to one specific location. We are currently living in Kuala Lumpur but we travel a lot and spend at least 3 months a year in Amsterdam for the last 3 years. To keep life interesting we planned to move to Amsterdam but moving to New York would work as well.
